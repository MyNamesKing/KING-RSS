# Particle Kinematics

## Rectilinear Kinematics

Rectilinear Kinematics is a simplified form of particle kinematics where the particle follows a rectilinear path (or straight line). This vastly simplifies the mathematics involved significantly, providing a great starting point for some models.

### Position
Due to the nature of rectilinear kinematics, the path of a particle will always be defined using a single coordinate axis, x. The distance from the origin of this axis will be labeled as **s**. This still counts as a vector however, which is is defined as positive to the right and negative to the left of the origin.
The displacement, or **change in position**, of the particle can be quantified as a vector as such:
$$\nabla s=s'-s$$

### Velocity


### Acceleration
